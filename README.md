Phishing Awareness Simulation Tool 🛡️
A fast, interactive way to test your phishing‑spotting instincts.

Cybersecurity isn’t just firewalls and fancy tools it’s people making decisions under pressure. This project recreates that moment: you’re shown a suspicious message, and you decide whether to Click, Ignore, or Report.
Instant feedback teaches you what you missed (or what you nailed).

## Why This Project Matters

Phishing is still one of the most common ways attackers gain access to accounts and systems.  
Most breaches don’t start with zero‑days they start with someone clicking the wrong link.

This tool focuses on the human side of cybersecurity:
- recognising red flags  
- slowing down before clicking  
- understanding attacker tactics  
- building instinct through repetition  

It’s simple on purpose.  
Real users don’t need complexity — they need clarity, confidence, and quick feedback.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – structure and layout  
- **CSS3** – styling, accessibility, and UI polish  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – scenario logic, scoring system, and user interaction  
- **GitHub Pages** – hosting and deployment  

## Key Features

- **Realistic phishing scenarios** based on common attacker tactics  
- **Instant feedback** explaining why each choice is safe or unsafe  
- **Progress indicator** to track how far you are through the simulation  
- **Scoring breakdown** showing correct reports, safe ignores, risky clicks, and mistakes  
- **Clean, accessible UI** designed for clarity and ease of use  
- **No frameworks required** — lightweight, fast, and easy to run anywhere

🎯 What This Project Does (in plain English)
Shows you realistic phishing scenarios

Lets you choose how to respond

Gives instant, clear feedback

Tracks your score

Summarises your performance at the end

Runs entirely in your browser — no data stored, no backend, no nonsense

It’s a bite‑sized cybersecurity training tool you can actually interact with.

🧠 Why I Built It
Phishing is still the number one way attackers get in.
I wanted to create something:

practical

interactive

easy for anyone to understand

and a solid addition to my cybersecurity portfolio

This project shows how I think about user behaviour, security awareness, and clear communication all essential skills for technical support and cyber roles.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5

CSS3 (dark theme + accessible light‑grey buttons)

JavaScript (ES6+)

No frameworks

No backend

No external libraries

Just clean, readable code.

🧩 How It Works
A scenario loads (e.g., fake delivery email, fake bank alert, CEO fraud).

You choose: Click, Ignore, or Report.

The tool tells you whether you were right and why.

You move to the next scenario.

At the end, you get a score and a short awareness summary.

It’s quick, simple, and surprisingly effective.

📚 What I Learned Building This
Designing interactive learning tools for security awareness

Structuring scenario‑based logic in JavaScript

Writing clear, user‑friendly explanations of phishing red flags

Improving accessibility and UI clarity

Iterating design based on real usability feedback

Presenting technical work in a way that’s actually engaging

## Behind the Scenes: How I Designed This Tool

I didn’t want this project to be “just another JavaScript exercise.”  
The goal was to build something practical something that reflects how real users interact with suspicious messages.

### 🧠 Designing the Scenarios
Each scenario is based on real phishing patterns:
- Urgency (“Your account will be closed today”)
- Fake delivery notifications
- Suspicious links
- Poor grammar or formatting
- Requests for personal information

I kept them short and realistic so users can make quick decisions, just like in real life.

### 🎨 UI & Accessibility Choices
The original UI was too dark and the buttons blended into the background.  
I redesigned the interface with:
- Light grey, high‑contrast buttons  
- Clear spacing  
- A simple, distraction‑free layout  

This makes the tool easier to use and more accessible for all users.

### 🧩 JavaScript Structure
The logic is intentionally simple and readable:
- An array of scenarios  
- A function to load each one  
- A scoring system  
- Instant feedback  
- A final summary  

No frameworks, no dependencies — just clean, maintainable code.

### 🔍 Focus on Cybersecurity Awareness
The feedback messages explain *why* a choice was right or wrong.  
This reinforces learning and mirrors real security training principles.

### 🚀 Iteration & Improvement
I refined the UI, added screenshots, improved the README, and polished the user flow based on how real people would interact with the tool.

## What I Learned

Building this project helped me strengthen several practical skills:

- Structuring a clean, accessible frontend without relying on frameworks  
- Writing clear, maintainable JavaScript for scenario logic and scoring  
- Designing user flows that feel intuitive and fast  
- Thinking like an attacker when crafting realistic phishing scenarios  
- Communicating security concepts in plain language  
- Iterating based on usability and clarity rather than complexity  

It reinforced that good cybersecurity tools don’t need to be complicated they need to be clear, reliable, and focused on real user behaviour.

🔮 Future Improvements

This project is intentionally simple and focused on core phishing awareness concepts, but there are several enhancements I may explore in the future:

- Add more scenarios covering SMS, WhatsApp, and social engineering calls  
- Introduce difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)  
- Add a timer to simulate real‑world decision pressure  
- Include a “Show me the red flags” mode after each scenario  
- Add sound or visual cues for correct/incorrect decisions  
- Expand the scoring breakdown with trend analysis  
- Add a backend to store user scores for training environments
