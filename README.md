Phishing Awareness Simulation Tool 🛡️
A fast, interactive way to test your phishing‑spotting instincts.

Cybersecurity isn’t just firewalls and fancy tools — it’s people making decisions under pressure. This project recreates that moment: you’re shown a suspicious message, and you decide whether to Click, Ignore, or Report.
Instant feedback teaches you what you missed (or what you nailed).

Built to be simple, fast, and actually fun to use.

🎯 What This Project Does (in plain English)
Shows you realistic phishing scenarios

Lets you choose how to respond

Gives instant, clear feedback

Tracks your score

Summarises your performance at the end

Runs entirely in your browser — no data stored, no backend, no nonsense

It’s a bite‑sized cybersecurity training tool you can actually interact with.

🧠 Why I Built It
Phishing is still the number one way attackers get in.
I wanted to create something:

practical

interactive

easy for anyone to understand

and a solid addition to my cybersecurity portfolio

This project shows how I think about user behaviour, security awareness, and clear communication — all essential skills for technical support and cyber roles.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5

CSS3 (dark theme + accessible light‑grey buttons)

JavaScript (ES6+)

No frameworks

No backend

No external libraries

Just clean, readable code.

🧩 How It Works
A scenario loads (e.g., fake delivery email, fake bank alert, CEO fraud).

You choose: Click, Ignore, or Report.

The tool tells you whether you were right — and why.

You move to the next scenario.

At the end, you get a score and a short awareness summary.

It’s quick, simple, and surprisingly effective.

📚 What I Learned Building This
Designing interactive learning tools for security awareness

Structuring scenario‑based logic in JavaScript

Writing clear, user‑friendly explanations of phishing red flags

Improving accessibility and UI clarity

Iterating design based on real usability feedback

Presenting technical work in a way that’s actually engaging

🔮 Future Improvements
More scenarios (SMS, WhatsApp, Teams, social media)

Difficulty levels

Progress bar

“Show me the red flags” mode

Light/dark mode toggle

Optional hints

Sound effects for correct/incorrect answers
